# Nocterial Palenight
This theme takes Noctis syntax highlighting and replaces color scheme with Material Palenight. A bit of added personal flair as well. Enjoy!

## Description
Syntax highlighting shamelessly stolen from [Noctis Theme](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis) by Liviu Schera and color scheme was shamelessly stolen from [Material Palenight Theme](https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-material-theme) by Mattia Astorino. I only write in python write now so I don't have other code samples, but if you look at both of the themes listed above you will get a good idea of what your code will look like. Or just install it and try it out!
